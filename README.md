# Data-Mining-2023-Assignment-1.2

HI I am Zunjie, This assignment compares and evaluates support vector machines and decision tree models on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census%2BIncome" title="超链接title">Adult</a> dataset, making an analysis of both models through a variety of evaluation metrics. All code units are run in _Google Colab_. Three main parts I have done in this Assignment.

# Data Pre-processing

This section focuses on understanding some basic information of the dataset and making pre-processing work such as outlier screening, null checking and normalization.

# Model Training

This section seeks the best combination of parameters by training this dataset separately using SVM and decision tree models with GridsearchCV to achieve the best training results.

# Comparison between two models

This section provides an in-depth comparison of the two models by evaluating some metrics such as accuracy, training time, AUC value, recall, F1 value, MSE, RMSE, etc.
